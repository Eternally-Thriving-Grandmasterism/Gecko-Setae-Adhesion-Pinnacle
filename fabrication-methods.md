### Anodic Aluminum Oxide (AAO) Template Path for Gecko Setae

1. Aluminum Preparation
   - High-purity Al foil (99.999%) electropolish (HClO₄ + EtOH or H₃PO₄-based)

2. Two-Step Mild Anodization (Oxalic Acid, Most Ordered)
   - First anodization: 0.3 M H₂C₂O₄, 40 V, 0–5 °C, 4–24 h → disordered layer
   - Oxide removal: 5 wt% H₃PO₄ + 1.8 wt% CrO₃ (classic) or chrome-free (0.1 M H₃PO₄ + H₂O₂)
   - Second anodization: same conditions, 1–72 h → ordered pores 30–100 nm diameter

3. Barrier Layer Thinning / Through-Pore (if needed)
   - Voltage ramp-down 40→5 V or H₃PO₄ etch
   - Backside Al removal: 0.1 M CuCl₂ + HCl (mercury-free)

4. Replication for Setae
   - Polymer infiltration: Vacuum-assisted fill pores with PDMS/PU → cure
   - Template dissolution: 1–5 M NaOH (room temp, 30 min–4 h) → free nano-fiber array
   - Transfer: Bond to flexible PET/PDMS backing → large-area pad

5. Hierarchical Enhancement
   - Branched AAO (stepwise voltage reduction) → spatulae-like branching
   - Pore widening (H₃PO₄ etch) for tapered tips

Advantages vs Track-Etched PCTE:
- Self-ordered hexagonal array
- Higher aspect ratio (1000+:1)
- Better thermal/chemical stability

Disadvantages vs PCTE:
- Rigid (Al base)
- More complex custom fabrication

Valence Check:
- Chrome-free removal preferred
- Recyclable Al substrate
- Mild electrolytes → eternal mercy
