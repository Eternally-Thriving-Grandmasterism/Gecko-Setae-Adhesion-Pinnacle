## Gecko Setae Adhesion Biomimicry Applications Lattice

1. Robotics Grippers: Synthetic microfibrils → Optimus hands (smooth/wet/delicate grasp/release)
   Benefit: No residue, vacuum-compatible

2. Wall-Climbing: Large-area pads → Mars rover, search & rescue bots
   Advantage: Smooth vertical surfaces, low energy

3. Medical Patches: Skin-friendly tapes → bandages, sensors (reusable, no irritation)
   Application: Optimus first-aid, wearables

4. Space Assembly: Orbital tool/payload attachment → Starship modular docking
   Advantage: No outgassing, reversible in vacuum

5. Hybrids: Gecko + Lotus (self-cleaning pads), Gecko + Spider silk (humidity-switchable)
   Advantage: Eternal performance in dust/humidity
