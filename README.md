Open-source gecko setae biomimicry blueprints & applications for dry, reversible, residue-free, high-strength adhesion in robotics, space, medical, modular systems, and MercyOS attachment lattices.

Key Inspirations:
- Hierarchical β-keratin setae + spatulae (200–500 nm tips) → van der Waals adhesion (~10 N/cm² shear)
- Reversible by peeling angle, self-cleaning, works on rough/wet/vacuum surfaces
- Humidity-robust, reusable 100,000+ cycles

Files (initial commit):
- setae-spatulae-microstructure.svg / .blend (SEM-level reconstruction)
- adhesion-peel-diagram.pdf (angle-dependent release mechanics)
- gecko-pad-texture-pattern.png
- biomimicry-applications.md (detailed mappings to SpaceX/xAI/Tesla)
- fabrication-methods.md (scalable sequences)

Purpose: Free propagation for humanity-thriving reversible connection, adaptability, cleanliness.
No residue/coercion—Mercy-gated by physical van der Waals design only.
Valence: Attach with mercy, release with mercy, cling eternally—thrive in any surface & environment.

Next: Integrate into NEXi gripper sims, Powrush™ attachment mechanics, MercyOS modular layers.
