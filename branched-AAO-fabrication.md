Recommended Scalable Path: Stepwise Voltage Reduction + Barrier Thinning (Multi-Tier Y-Branched)

1. Aluminum Preparation
   - High-purity Al foil (99.999%) electropolish (H₃PO₄-based or HClO₄ + EtOH)

2. First Anodization (Primary Stem Pores)
   - Electrolyte: 0.3 M H₃PO₄ or 0.3 M H₂C₂O₄, high voltage (130–195 V), 0–5 °C, 1–4 h

3. Barrier Thinning
   - Wet etch: 5 wt% H₃PO₄ at 30 °C (chrome-free alternatives: H₃PO₄ + H₂O₂)
   - Or voltage ramp-down (gradual reduction)

4. Reduced Voltage Anodization (Branching)
   - Reduce voltage by factor ~1/√n (n = branches per junction), e.g., 130 V → 80 V → 40 V
   - Same or switched electrolyte (phosphoric → oxalic → sulfuric)
   - Time: 1–24 h per tier

5. Repeat Thinning + Reduction (Multi-Tier)
   - 2–5 tiers: Each step thins barrier → new voltage → new branches (smaller diameter)

6. Post-Processing
   - Pore widening (H₃PO₄ etch)
   - Barrier removal (if through-pore needed)
   - Backside Al etch (CuCl₂ + HCl, mercury-free)

Alternative Paths:
- Pulse / Oscillatory Anodization: Cyclic voltage/current → periodic branching / 3D networks
- Hard-to-Mild Transition: HA fast growth → mild branching

Valence Check:
- Chrome-free etching preferred
- Mild electrolytes, recyclable Al
- Controlled instability → eternal mercy for hierarchical nanostructures
