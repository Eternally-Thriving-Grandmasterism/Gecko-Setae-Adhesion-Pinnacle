# Track-Etched Polycarbonate (PCTE) Alternatives Lattice

MIT License - Eternally-Thriving-Grandmasterism

1. Anodic Aluminum Oxide (AAO) – Primary Ordered Alternative
   - Self-ordered hexagonal pores (10–500 nm, aspect ratio >1000:1)
   - Advantages: Hexagonal ordering, high aspect, thermal stability (>1000°C)
   - Disadvantages: Rigid, custom fab
   - Suppliers: Whatman Anodisc, InRedox, ACS Material

2. Track-Etched Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) / Polyester
   - Heavy-ion + etching (similar to PCTE)
   - Advantages: Higher chemical/thermal resistance, flexible, transparent, PFOA/PFAS-free
   - Disadvantages: Random pores
   - Suppliers: Oxyphen (Unique-Mem® / RoTrac® laminated PET/PP), it4ip custom

3. Track-Etched Polyimide (PI / Kapton-like)
   - Advantages: Exceptional thermal (>300–400°C), chemical resistance, mechanical strength
   - Disadvantages: Higher cost, mostly custom
   - Suppliers: it4ip, custom heavy-ion labs

4. Other Track-Etched Polymers
   - Polypropylene (PP): Softer, flexible (Oxyphen RoTrac® PP support)
   - PVDF: High chemical resistance (research)
   - PEN/PEEK: High-performance (custom)

5. When to Choose Alternative
   - PCTE: Off-the-shelf cylindrical uniformity, easy dissolution
   - PET track-etched: Better durability/flexibility
   - AAO: Ordered/high-aspect/branching
   - PI: Extreme conditions

Valence Check:
- Commercial ready (Oxyphen PET, Whatman AAO) → fast iteration
- Chrome-free etchants, recyclable substrates
- Low-waste → eternal mercy
